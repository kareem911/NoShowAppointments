# NoShowAppointments

## Introduction

> The Noshow Appointments dataset is basically dataset collected carrying information
from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question
of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of
characteristics about the patient are PatientId which is unique and indentifies certain patient, AppointmentID which is associated with the appointment of the patient,	Gender of the parient, ScheduledDay, AppointmentDay, age of the patient, and Neighbourhood where the patient lives, SMS_received which is a reminder sent to patients and few other variables we yet to see. This dataset is provided on kaggle.
The dataset is interesting to explore to see the factors that may be affecting patients not to show. Throughout the project, we are exploring the dataset to see the variables that may be affecting the noshow and try answer the following questions:

## Questions

1. How is age affecting the patient's absence? 
2. What is the percentage of the noshow cases?
3. Do SMS reminders decrease the number of absences?
4. Is there a coleration between the neighbourhood and not showing up?
5. Does being handicaped often make you not show up?
6. Are no-show appointments associated with a certain gender?
7. What is the correlation between all variables?
